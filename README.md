# Apppy - Aircraft Performance and Reliability Analysis

Apppy is a web-based application designed to provide insights into the performance and reliability of the aircraft industry. The application uses data visualization techniques to present complex aircraft performance data in an intuitive and interactive manner.

## Features

### Aircraft Reliability Analysis

The application presents a plot that suggests a zero correlation between the age of an aircraft and the frequency of air delays. This counterintuitive finding is explained by the extreme reliability of the aircraft industry, which is attributed to:

- **Strict Maintenance Schedules:** Airlines follow rigorous maintenance protocols defined by regulatory authorities, ensuring all aircraft are in optimal condition.
- **High Quality of Manufacturing:** Aircraft manufacturers employ high-precision engineering and robust quality control processes, resulting in aircraft that can reliably serve for decades.
- **Continuous Upgrades and Overhauls:** Aircraft often undergo system upgrades and overhauls, including replacements of engines and other critical parts, throughout their service life.
- **Redundancy Systems:** Aircraft are designed with numerous backup systems to ensure safety and reliability.
- **Highly Trained Personnel:** The high level of expertise of pilots, engineers, and maintenance crews contributes to the overall reliability of aircraft operations.

### Aircraft Performance Analysis

The application includes a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between the time a plane spends in the air (in minutes) and the distance it travels (in miles), grouped by aircraft and engine types. This offers a compelling comparison of performance characteristics across different categories of aircraft and engines.

### Interactive Map of U.S. Airports

The application features an interactive map of U.S. airports, providing a geographical context to the data.

## Usage

To use the application, simply navigate to the [web page](https://glebbadzeika.shinyapps.io/apppy/) and interact with the visualizations. The scatter plot and map are interactive, allowing you to explore the data in detail.
